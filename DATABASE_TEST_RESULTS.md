# Database Test Results

## ✅ **What's Working:**
- All database tables exist and are accessible
- Basic database connection is successful
- Tables created: `profiles`, `user_settings`, `external_courses`, `enrolled_courses`

## ❌ **Issues Found:**

### 1. **Sign-up Process Failing**
- Error: "Database error saving new user"
- This is likely due to RLS (Row Level Security) policies being too restrictive

### 2. **Manual Profile Creation Failing**
- Error: "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'profiles'"
- RLS policies are preventing profile creation during sign-up

## 🔧 **Solution:**

### **Step 1: Run the RLS Fix Script**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `nhuxwgmafdjchljvqlna`
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of `fix_rls_policies.sql`
5. Click **Run**

### **Step 2: Test Again**
After running the fix script, run the test again:
```bash
node test-db.js
```

### **Step 3: Test in Your Application**
1. Try signing up with a new account in your web application
2. Check if the sign-in process works
3. Verify that user profiles are created automatically

## 📋 **What the Fix Does:**

✅ **Fixes RLS Policies:**
- Makes policies more permissive for authenticated users
- Allows profile creation during sign-up
- Maintains security while enabling functionality

✅ **Improves Error Handling:**
- The trigger function now handles errors gracefully
- Won't fail the entire sign-up if profile creation has issues

✅ **Grants Proper Permissions:**
- Ensures authenticated users can create and manage their data
- Maintains security boundaries

## 🧪 **Test Commands:**

```bash
# Run the database test
node test-db.js

# Open the browser test
start test-database-connection.html
```

## 📊 **Expected Results After Fix:**

- ✅ All tables accessible
- ✅ Sign-up process successful
- ✅ Profile creation working
- ✅ Manual profile creation working
- ✅ User settings creation working

## 🚨 **If Issues Persist:**

1. **Check Supabase Logs:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Logs
   - Look for any error messages

2. **Verify Email Confirmation:**
   - Check if sign-up emails are being sent
   - Verify email confirmation is working

3. **Test with Different Email:**
   - Try signing up with a different email address
   - Some email providers might block test emails

## 📞 **Next Steps:**

1. Run the `fix_rls_policies.sql` script in Supabase
2. Test the sign-up process again
3. Let me know the results so I can help with any remaining issues
